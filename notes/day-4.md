### How to make your message come through

1. Structure storytelling
2. Make the message stand out by de-cluttering
3. Use appropriate visualizations.

### Storytelling process

1. Define problem
   - data analysis process
2. Visualize
3. Present

### Defining the problem

1. Ask the right questions
2. Use the [5 Whys](https://www.lean.org/lexicon-terms/5-whys/)
3. Frame hypothesis

### Visuals 

**1. Trust is key**
    - accurate representation
    - highlight focus areas
*without trust, analytics experts will be ignored*

**2. Story development is a process**
   - build a logical order
   - remove distractions
   - focus your audience
   - present effectively

**3. Objective/Hook is *critical***
   - why are we here?
   - what will you say?
   - is this what the audience is here for?
   - focus on key points

**4. Story puts together conclusions**
- Business situation
- key results
- visualizations
- recommendations
- Summarize
- ask for feedback

### Keep it Simple

- How and what you display can make your message clear or disrupt your entire presentation.
- Defaults are not always best for visuals.

### Charts/Graphs, etc.
- Line charts key workhorse graph
- Horizontal bar graph good for survey data
- Waterfall chart for tracking changes by cause
- Scatter plot works for two-dimensional data (x-y correlation)
- Maps for geographical data - easy way to visualize lots of data
- Network graphs - highly specialized and used to show interconnections
- Word clouds - use with caution
- Text *the power of 1 letter, 1 number on a page -- simple text but must tell the story to get the point across*
- Photos/Logos - *Does the image match the message?*
- Heatmaps - use with caution; need to be able to see the pattern

### The 'Please Don't' List
- Pie charts
- Donut charts
- 3-D versions

### Cognitive Aspects of Design
- Gestalt Principles
  - Enclosure (Box/Shading)
  - Connection (shows relationship or direction)
  - Closure (circle first then details)
  - Continuity (alighment without lines)
  - Similarity (color/shapes/fill)
  - Proximity (space seperates group/orientation)
 
### Pre-Attentive Attributes

*Use 8-9 of these*

1. Orientation
2. Shape
3. Line length
4. Line width
5. Size
6. Curvature
7. Added marks
8. Enclosure
9. Hue
10. Intensity
11. Spatial position
12. Motion

*Gestaut Principles + Preventative Attributes ---> Practice of Decluttering

- titles
- borders/gridlines - removal?
- labels/axix - simplify
- data markers - necesary?
- color/hue - key aspects
- size
- alignment

**What is the *one* key message for the slide?**

### Hands-On Exercise
Daily COVID cases in GA Counties

- Original visualization was a mess
- Exercise - analyze data to improve
- Presenter: pulled data for 1 county to visualize a COVID cluster (using principles we talked about)


### Summary
**1. Frame story for maximum impact**

**2. Declutter visuals so message comes through**

**3. Simple visuals are most effective**
