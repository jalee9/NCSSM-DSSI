[Thinking Through the Data Investigation Process](https://cdn.instepwithdata.org/ThinkingDataInvestigationProcess.pdf)

1. Frame problem.
2. Consider and gather data.
3. Process data.
4. Explore and visualize data.
5. Consider models.
6. Communicate and propose action.

### Key Considerations and Dispositions

2. Take advantage of technology.
3. Attend to variability and uncertainty.
4. See expertise and information.
5. Communicate and collaborate.
6. Be curious, creative, and intiutive.
7. Persist and be resilient.
8. Consider ethical issues and biases.
9. Be a skeptic.
