# Day 2 - July 9, 2024

## Data Science 4 Everyone - University of Chicago 
[Data4Everyone](https://www.datascience4everyone.org/)
- What's going on with Data Science from a National lense

### State of the Field

- dominating top jobs/industries
- How much data has been generated to date?
    - 2010  2 Zetabytes
    - 2025  175+ Zetabytes

 **1 ZB equivalent to 1 Billion USB drives**
 - 1 phone book = 1 MB 
 - Visualized - phone books stacked from Earth to space -- 23.6 Billion miles (past the solar system) 
     - will double by 2030
     - digital footprint has outpaced physical 
     - 30 trillion web pages
  
### Today's workers *Daily* Math Use

- Use Excel (66%)
- Use databases (43%)
- Analyze & Interpret data (31%)
- Visualize data (23%)

### What workers wished they learned in school

- Data analysis and interpretation (64%)
- Data visualization (60%)
- Excel (48%)
- Database (45%)

**1 in 4 jobs require basic data science**

(Source: 2019 - 2022 Linked In/Glassdoor/ DOL SCOCO Skill codes)

- Data analysis shows up as top skill in 56% of job searches

### Growth

- AI (62.2.%)
- Data analysis (17.7%)

### Occupations featuring skills

- AI (14.2%)
- Data analysis (59.9%)

### Landscape Analysis

1. Utilities
2. Manufacturing
3. Agriculture
4. Professional/Scientific
5. Information

(Data from Burning Glass Institute)

### College Preparation

- 138 college disciplines now require data and statistics coursework

** Separating fact from fiction is now very difficult **

### LLMs

- Automated prediction model
      - prompt (text data in)
      - output (text data out)
      - Model acts like a function modifying input/output

- LLM constructed by people
- Multi-variable linear equation
- It looks like the equation for the weighted average
- Given a large dataset to train
- finds predictions based on all textual data to understand correlations

training data at large n --> Validation --> General model for repeated queries

### Exercise (To try in class)

- ChatGPT a statement (Example: "Tell me if wine is good for me")
- Analyze response
- Conduct independent research to determine if factual

### Critical Mission
- Catalyze the adoption of data science and data literacy as an integrated component of K-12 education by 2030

**Private companies valued at 1B+**
- [NC - Avidxchange](https://ap.avidxchange.com/)

### What do students think?

- 55% want more data skills
- 42% want to understand more about different cultures
- More time developing real-world practical skills
- 59% learn more about managing money and budgets
- 42% learn more about protecting the planet

1-5 scale usefulness of learning data science to career (4 avg)
1-5 scale usefulness of learning data science to college readiness (4 avg)

Students want to understand how data can be misleading.
How to use data to weigh everyday decisions.
Learning basic coding tools.
Understand how data skills impact career opportunities.

### How do we address the need for data science education

Building a national data learning progression
- focus groups
- education leaders
- K-12, 2 year, 4 year institutions
- Urban/suburban/rural
- Public/private

Integration into core school subjects
- bridges disciplines

Introduce legislation
- Data Science & Literacy Act of 2023

Implementation Tiers

- Tier 1: Course added to state course catalog (NC is in Tier 1)
- Tier 2: Course pilot, course sequence or teacher PD
- Tier 3: Standards or framework adoption

Grade Band Implementation

- K-12
- HS Only (9-12) ** NC is in this band **
- Elementary Only (K-5)

*NCSSM is a national leader*

### Thoughts/Questions

- Updated career clusters (data science/AI)
- Updated pathways
- Elevator pitch to edu admin -- share the data on careers/skills needed
- Survey on career clusters
