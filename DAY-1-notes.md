# Day 1 - July 8, 2024

## Icebreaker Activity
### TED talk data portraits - Giorgia Lupi (look it up)
- Reminder when working with data, real person behind the data
- Ask a series of questions and then shape/icon/color represents the data point

## Extra Credit
### Dear Data Project (YouTube Video)
- Pick something to focus on and log some data about it
- Collect data
- Friday, draw the visualization & swap with others

## Learning Outcomes
1. What is Data Science?
2. Why teach Data Science?
3. How to teach Data Science?
4. Who teaches Data Science?
5. What tools do instructors/students need to know?

## What is Data Science?
- Foundations
- Applications
- Implications

## Data Analysis

- Import
- TIDY
- Transform
- Visualize
- Model
- Communicate - ** how you tell the story **

## Data Collection and Exploration

- Collect
- Clean
- Combine
- Visualize

## Inference and simulation

- Quantify significance
- Perform Hypothesis testing
- Randomization

## Prediction and classification
- Informed quantitative guesses
- Regression and classification techniques
- Intro to machine learning

## How is data science different than statistics?

- Scale ** big vs small ** (work with large datasets due to computing tools)
- Evolving towards an era of open research --
    - when working with data properly documented, you contribute to the body of research
- Tools to solve reproductive issues (produce papers but can't reproduce)
- Moving towards ALL parts of the published research (data, code, tools, etc.)

## Tools

- CODAP - drag and drop/open source/web-based
- R Studio
- Python
- Juypter
- Excel
- StatKey

** Think about your outcomes when you pick your tool **
** Principles transcend the tool ** 

## Teaching Data Science

- How to get started
    - NC State virtual program (see slide)

## DataHub

- ncshare.org -- Grants for data hubs

## Tidy Data
- each variable forms a column
- each observation forms a row
- each cell is single measurement

** tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure **

- standard structure = tidy data means datasets alike
- same tools in similar ways
- untidy data one time approach hard to iterate or reuse
- cleaning vs. wrangling
